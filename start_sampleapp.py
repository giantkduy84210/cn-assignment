~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This module provides a sample RESTful web application using the WeApRous framework.

It defines basic route handlers and launches a TCP-based backend server to serve
HTTP requests. The application includes a login endpoint and a greeting endpoint,
and can be configured via command-line arguments.
